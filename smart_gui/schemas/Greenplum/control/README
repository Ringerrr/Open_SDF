We have, at one point, been able to host the 'control' and 'log' databases
on Greenplum. This support has *not* been kept maintained, as there is
very little benefit, and it's additional work to keep it maintained and tested.

I have *not* deleted any code ( in particular, there is code in the ETL framework
for Greenplum metadata hosting ).

To ressurect support for hosting metadata on Greenplum, the easiest way is to:

a) Commercial use? Use SDF's migration wizard to generate DDL from an existing
   Postgres metadata installation.

b) Open source use // no access to SDF migration wizard? Dump the metadata
   database using pg_dump and modify it by hand to execute on Greenplum.
