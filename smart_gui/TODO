data loader ==> harvest job ... copy DATESTYLE setting into Postgres template(s)?

We should probably redo the data loader to trigger an ETL job ( ie a seed job ) to perform the load. This screen is getting a bit hacky ...

When executing some SQL ...

 - create a new SQLite in-memory DB
 - create a new target DB connection
 - spawn a new thread, and execute the SQL there
 - fetch results into in-memory DB
 - return a signal to the main thread, which should then create a new datasheet on the in-memory DB
